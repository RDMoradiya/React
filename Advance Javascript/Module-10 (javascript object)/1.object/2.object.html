    <!-- objects :-
        In JavaScript, objects are king. If you understand objects, you understand JavaScript.
        Booleans can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)
        Numbers can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)
        Strings can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)
        Dates are always objects
        Maths are always objects
        Regular expressions are always objects
        Arrays are always objects
        Functions are always objects
        Objects are always objects
        All JavaScript values, except primitives, are objects.
        It is a common practice to declare objects with the const keyword. -->

      // JavaScript Objects are Mutable :-
      // Objects are mutable: They are addressed by reference, not by value.
      // If person is an object, the following statement will not create a copy of person:

      const nm = {
        firstName: "John",

      //   Deleting Properties :-
      //   The delete keyword deletes both the value of the property and the property itself.
      //   After deletion, the property cannot be used before it is added back again.
      //   The delete operator is designed to be used on object properties. It has no effect on variables or functions.
      //   The delete operator should not be used on predefined JavaScript object properties. It can crash your application.
