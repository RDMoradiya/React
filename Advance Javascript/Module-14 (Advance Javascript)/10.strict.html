  <!-- strict :-

    -> The "use strict" directive was new in ECMAScript version 5.
    -> It is a directive that is used to indicate that a program is to be run in strict mode.
    -> You can use strict mode in all your programs. It helps you to write cleaner code, like preventing you from using undeclared variables.
    -> Strict mode is declared by adding "use strict"; to the beginning of a script or a function.   -->
