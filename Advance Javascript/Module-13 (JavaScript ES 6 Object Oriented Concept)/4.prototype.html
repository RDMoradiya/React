  <!-- Prototype :-
    -> All JavaScript objects inherit properties and methods from a prototype.
    -> Date objects inherit from Date.prototype
    -> Array objects inherit from Array.prototype
    -> Person objects inherit from Person.prototype
    -> The Object.prototype is on the top of the prototype inheritance chain:
    Date objects, Array objects, and Person objects inherit from Object.prototype.
 -->
