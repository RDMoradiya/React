(1) Arithmetic
        +   (additions)
        -   (subtractions)
        *   (multiplication)
        /   (division)
        %   (modulus=remainder)
        ++  (increment)
        --  (decrement)

(2) logical :-
        &&  (logical and)
        ||  (logical or)
        !   (logical not)

        =  
        += 
        -=
        *=
        /=
        %=

(4) comperision :-
        < (less than)
        > (greater than)
        <= (less than or equals to)
        >= (greater than or equals to)
        == (equal)
        === (equal value and equal data type)
        != (not equal)

        & (and)
        | (or)
